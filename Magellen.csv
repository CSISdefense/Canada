Phase A ASU will produce an initial mechanical design for the GUSSTO cold optics assembly, and analyze this design for manufacturability and mechanical tolerances. The design will be refined to ensure that ASU will be able to manufacture the design within the required tolerances demanded by the optical design. ASU will also work with the detector and local oscillator groups at JPL, University of Arizona and SRON to optimize their designs for manufacturability. ASU will also provide micromachined components for proof-of-concept hardware for GUSSTO detectors and optics as needed for the project.",
