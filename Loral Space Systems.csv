This effort will involve a conversion to a turbine heavy fuel engine, creating a viable platform for Naval missions; and rapid prototyping of the modified systems. An upgrade of the power plant from the piston engine to a suitable turbine engine will allow the use of Heavy Fuel, which is preferred for Navy operations as well as all other maritime uses. Integration of the Turbine engine advances SA-200 performance and also offers a number of other benefits including lower weight and less heat inside the aircraft.  .
